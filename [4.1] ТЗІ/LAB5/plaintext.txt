To solve this problem, where discs (or other items) are stacked on a rod in a random order and you need to move them to the same or another rod so that they are sorted, you can use an algorithm that uses three rods. The basic idea is to use an additional (temporary) rod for sorting. The basic algorithm: Let's start with three rods: A, B, and C. Rod A contains the original discs, rod B is the temporary rod for sorting, and rod C is the empty rod where we will move the sorted discs. We'll use a sorting algorithm, such as QuickSort or MergeSort, to sort the discs on the A-pillar. That is, we split the discs into smaller groups and move them to the B spindle, if necessary. After all the discs have been moved to the B drive and sorted, they will be in the correct order on the B drive. Now, we move the discs from rod B to rod C in the correct order to get the sorted sequence on rod C. As a result, we will get the sorted sequence on the C-pillar, and the task is completed. As for additional functions that may be useful, we can use the functions to view the status of the rods, which display the current configuration of the discs on the rods. This can help us monitor the sorting process and verify that the task is being performed correctly.
